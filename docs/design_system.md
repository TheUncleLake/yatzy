# Yatzy's Design System

A single-player game where 5 dice are rolled each turn. After each roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. The player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn. The player must put a score or zero into a score box each turn. The game ends when all score boxes are used.

## Appearance

### General

- Fonts: Arial, sans-serif
- Colors: Brown frame, dark green board, white dice with black dots, white table with green text (sometimes red text) and lines

### Dice

Five dice will appear on the dark green board when the player rolls the dice. Each dice will be shown in bird's eye view as a rounded square. The number of black dots on the die when viewed from above indicates the value of the roll. After rolling the dice, clicking on a die on the dark green board puts it into a separate rectangular tray, which indicates which dice the player keeps. The dice that remain in the board will be rerolled if the player chooses to do so.
